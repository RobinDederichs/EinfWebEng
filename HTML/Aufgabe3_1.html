            <p>CSS3 Introduced Media Queries
                Media queries in CSS3 extended the CSS2 media types idea: Instead of looking for a type of device, they look at the capability of the device.

                Media queries can be used to check many things, such as:

                width and height of the viewport
                width and height of the device
                orientation (is the tablet/phone in landscape or portrait mode?)
                resolution
                Using media queries are a popular technique for delivering a tailored style sheet to desktops, laptops, tablets, and mobile phones (such as iPhone and Android phones).</p>
